# RSA-Encryption-System
This is my implementation of an RSA Encryption system

In this program, it starts out by generating two large prime numbers between 1 billion and 10 billion and uses those as the P and Q to create the public and private keys.

While Running the program, it gives the user the option to act as both a public user and a private user. The public user is able to send an encrypted message that becomes encrypted by the public key. A Public user is also able to authenticate a digital signature with the public key. The private user is able to decrypt a message with the private key, create a digital signature with the private key, show the public and private keys, and generate new public and private keys.
